The casino frequently hosts promotions with progressive jackpots and cash prize draws. Seasonal events like \u201cSpooky Spins\u201d on Halloween and \u201cProgressive Quick Draws\u201d add excitement and variety to the experience.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>On-site, guests can enjoy a cozy restaurant and bar serving local cuisine, including steak and lobster, along with refreshing drinks. Evenings are often enhanced by live performances, including concerts by well-known Canadian artists like The Johner Brothers, especially during festive occasions like New Year\u2019s Eve.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>While there is no hotel directly on the premises, several nearby accommodations offer comfortable lodging for casino guests. Conveniently located off Highway 16, the casino is easily accessible to both locals and travelers.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p> The SIGA Rewards loyalty program allows players to earn points, enjoy free play, receive restaurant discounts, and enter exclusive draws.

To avoid any inconvenience and feel confident, it\u2019s important to understand the basic rules, dress code, and entry requirements beforehand.\n<\/p>\n<br><p> Most casinos follow a \u201csmart style\u201d policy, meaning your attire should be neat, clean, and appropriate for the setting. While daytime visits may allow more relaxed clothing, evenings typically require a more elegant look. Casinos aim to maintain a comfortable and respectable environment, and guest appearance plays a key role in that.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<p> Proper etiquette is also expected: respect for staff, fellow players, and the gaming process is essential. Entry is allowed only for adults, and ID may be required at the door.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">General Visitor Rules<\/h4>\n\n <ul>\n            <li>\u2022 Entry allowed from age 18+ (or 19+, depending on region)\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 No aggressive or disruptive behavior\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 Photography of gaming tables and staff is prohibited\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>\u2022 Respect other players\u2019 personal space\n\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul><br>\n\n<div\n lang=\"en\"\n     style=\"\n       -webkit-columns: 320px 2;\n       -moz-columns: 320px 2;\n       columns: 320px 2;\n\n        -webkit-column-gap: 1.2em;\n       -moz-column-gap: 1.2em;\n       column-gap: 1.2em;\n \n       hyphens: auto;\n\">\n\n\n   <!-- \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 -->\n    <div style=\"break-inside: avoid; -webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; -moz-column-break-inside: avoid;\">\n        <h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Dress Code<\/h4>\n            <ul>\n            <li>\u2022 Men: collared shirt, trousers, dress shoes\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 Women: dress, blouse with skirt or pants\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 Not allowed: shorts, sportswear, beach sandals, torn or dirty clothing\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 Evening visits call for more formal attire\n\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n        <br>\n\n\n    <\/div>\n\n    <!-- \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0430 -->\n    <div style=\"break-inside: avoid; -webkit-column-break-inside: avoid; -moz-column-break-inside: avoid;\">\n        <h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Entry Conditions<\/h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\u2022 ID check may be required\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 Non-compliance with dress code may result in denied entry\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 VIP areas and tournaments may require stricter dress standards\n\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul>\n        <br>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<br>\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nSIGA Rewards: Your Path to Exclusive Benefits\n<\/h3>\n\n<p> The SIGA Rewards loyalty program is a revamped player rewards system designed with guest feedback in mind.
